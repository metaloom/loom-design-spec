# Extension

Extensions can be registered on the API. On specific events loom would invoke the extension. The extension can thus react onto the event and process for example an asset (e.g. virus scan). 

NOTE: Extensions are conflicting with pipelines. Currently pipelines seem to be a far more flexible approach.
